Apollo

Apollo is a set of tools for building GraphQL applications, especially suited for building on top of your existing data. There are three main components that you can use to build a production-ready GraphQL app ie. Apollo Client, Apollo Server and Apollo Engine.

GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Query

A GraphQL query is used to read or fetch values while a mutation is used to write or post values. In either case, the operation is a simple string that a GraphQL server can parse and respond to with data in a specific format.

Mutation

Mutation queries modify data in the data store and returns a value. ... It can be used to insert, update, or delete data. Mutations are defined as a part of the schema.

Subscription

Subscriptions are GraphQL operations that watch events emitted from Apollo Server. The native Apollo Server supports GraphQL subscriptions without additional configuration. All integrations that allow HTTP servers, such as express and Hapi, also provide GraphQL subscriptions.
